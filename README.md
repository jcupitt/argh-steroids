# Argh-steroids

Asteroids-like game using pygame. Python 3 compatible.
Install [pygame](http://pygame.org) and run `main.py`.

Alternatively, there's a [WebGL 
version](http://jcupitt.github.io/argh-steroids-webgl).

# Features

* Asteroids bounce off each other. It uses a map to make collision detection
  fast.

* Your ship has a shield and you can bump into asteroids a few times. The
  shield regenerates slowly.

* Mouse and keyboard controls.

* Vector graphics using an affine transform rather than a lot of trig
  functions. 

* Particle system for explosions.

* Small, simple code. It's only 1,300 lines for everything, it should be easy 
  to hack on.

* It's fast enough on a Raspberry-Pi 2. On my modest laptop it can animate 
  more than 200 asteroids and more than 5,000 particles at 60 fps.

# Secret keys

* Hold 'S' during level start animation to spawn extra asteroids for testing.

* Hold 'I' to see object and FPS counts.

* Press 'P' to toggle particles on and off. This can help the framerate
  on slower systems.

* Press 'N' to skip to the next level. Handy for testing. 

# TODO

* More sounds, audio on/off.

* Can we make sound less laggy? There's a long pause between pressing fire and
  the shot sound being played, for example. 

* Have a key to change shield behaviour on the start-screen.

* Collision detection is just touching circles, we could look at the geometry
  as well to get pixel-perfect detection.

* Collision physics just exchanges the two velocities, we could do true
  billiard-ball collisions.

* The wrap-around is rather crude. We could draw sprites as they wrap.

* Gravity, grappling hook, bombs, etc.

# Changes

Text character designs taken from https://github.com/rickwight/meteors

John Cupitt, 24/5/15

* Copy sounds from webgl version.

* Added annoying background music.

Pierce Lally, 21/5/15

* Added sounds.

* Made python 3 compatible.

* Option for "conventional" shield behaviour.  Shield mode 1 uses a key
  press ("F") and stays on for a period of time before turning off. There
  is a cool down between key presses. Use 0 for author's original shield
  mode. User can select SHIELDBEHAVIOR with the global variable on line
  23 in ship.py.
